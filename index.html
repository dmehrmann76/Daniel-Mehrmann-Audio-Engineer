            Daniel Mehrmann is an award winning songwriter, producer, and mixer. He started

          Composition in 2003, he went on to setup, and remains the coordinator of, the Music
          Technology program at Southwestern Illinois College while also working for Apple and

          recording studio, Jettison Studios, 45 minutes outside of St. Louis for a retreat-style facility.
          Offering a totally distraction free recording experience, local acts like Beth Bombara, Funky
          Butt Brass Band, The Gorge, Mikey Wehling, Adult Fur, and his own band, Dropkick the
          Robot, have recorded/mixed multiple albums in the space as well as housing Rockford,
